## TODO:

* Better handling of the modifier argument (this should only show when an argument is able to passed to the Faker constructor).
* Coercing of the modifier argument into the object type the Faker constructor is expecting.
(Both of these items requires some way to know that what arguments and types the Faker constructor is expecting; if you know of a good way to figure this out, please let me know!)
