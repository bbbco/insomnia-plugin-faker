# insomnia-plugin-faker

Generate Faker data right within the Insomnia REST Client!

## Limitations:

Be sure to reference the Faker API docs to determine what type of arguments should be passed to the Optional Modifier argument.

The Optional Modifier argument can take a string, or list of items, or a JSON encoded object as arguments. If you have to pass several arguments in at a time, try wrapping them in square brackets (`[]`).

The Optional Modifier cannot take a callback argument (as in the Helpers > Maybe option), and may not work correctly for every Faker function. YMMV.

## TODO:

- Figure out how to pull the Faker categories out programmatically. Currently, we just define them in a hard-coded array.
- Better handling of the modifier argument (this should only show when an argument is able to passed to the Faker constructor).
- Coercing of the modifier argument into the object type the Faker constructor is expecting.
  (Both of these items requires some way to know that what arguments and types the Faker constructor is expecting; if you know of a good way to figure this out, please let me know!)
